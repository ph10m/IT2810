                <strong>Doge</strong> (often pronounced /ˈdoʊʒ/ DOHZH or /ˈdoʊɡ/ DOHG) is an Internet meme that became popular in 2013.
                The meme typically consists of a picture of a Shiba Inu accompanied by multicolored text in <span id="comic">Comic</span><span id="comic">Sans</span> font in the foreground.
                The text, representing a kind of internal monologue, is deliberately written in a form of broken English.

                <p>The meme is based on a 2010 photograph, and became popular in late 2013, being named as Know Your Meme's "top meme" of that year.</p>
                <p>A cryptocurrency based on Doge, the Dogecoin, was launched in December 2013, and the Shiba Inu has been featured on Josh Wise's NASCAR car as part of a sponsorship deal.</p>
                <p>Kabosu (Japanese: かぼす), the female Shiba Inu featured in the original meme, was a pedigree puppy who was sent to an animal shelter when her puppy mill shut down. She was adopted in 2008 by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Satō, and named after the citrus fruit Kabosu because Sato thought she had a round face like the fruit.[4] Another Shiba Inu featured in the meme is Suki, a female belonging to photographer Jonathan Fleming from San Francisco. His wife had accidentally put a scarf in the wash, making it shrink. He took a photograph of Suki wearing the scarf outside on a cold night in February 2010.</p>
