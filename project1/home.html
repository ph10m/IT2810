                <strong>Doge</strong> (often pronounced /ˈdoʊʒ/ DOHZH or /ˈdoʊɡ/ DOHG) is an Internet meme that became popular in 2013.
                The meme typically consists of a picture of a Shiba Inu accompanied by multicolored text in <span class="comic">Comic</span><span class="comic">Sans</span> font in the foreground.
                The text, representing a kind of internal monologue, is deliberately written in a form of broken English.

            <!-- Text shown upon pressing above button -->
            <div class="moarText">
                <p>The meme is based on a 2010 photograph, and became popular in late 2013, being named as Know Your Meme's "top meme" of that year.</p>
                <p>A cryptocurrency based on Doge, the Dogecoin, was launched in December 2013, and the Shiba Inu has been featured on Josh Wise's NASCAR car as part of a sponsorship deal.</p>
                <p>Kabosu (Japanese: かぼす), the female Shiba Inu featured in the original meme, was a pedigree puppy who was sent to an animal shelter when her puppy mill shut down. She was adopted in 2008 by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Satō, and named after the citrus fruit Kabosu because Sato thought she had a round face like the fruit.[4] Another Shiba Inu featured in the meme is Suki, a female belonging to photographer Jonathan Fleming from San Francisco. His wife had accidentally put a scarf in the wash, making it shrink. He took a photograph of Suki wearing the scarf outside on a cold night in February 2010.</p>
		<p>
		The Japanese perception is remarkably different; Satō and Kabosu are rather known as a pet and owner rather than a meme, and her blog is the fourth-most popular pet-related blog in the country as of December 2013. Reacting to the meme, she explained, "To be honest, some pictures are strange for me, but it's still funny! I’m very impressed with their skills and taste. Around me, nobody knows about the doge meme. Maybe I don't understand memes very well, because I'm living a such an analog life." Satō has also expressed that she had learned that "the risk of the internet is that anyone in the world can see my life on my blog". Fleming stated that in his experience, the Shiba Inu breed has become more recognised due to the meme.<p>
